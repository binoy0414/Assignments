Got it. You want **Git Bash commands inside Eclipse terminal** to push your project to the **main** branch of your GitHub repo.

Run these one-by-one in your Eclipse Git Bash terminal:

---

### **1. Go to your project folder**

```sh
cd C:/Users/binoy/eclipse-workspace/Assignments
```

---

### **2. Initialize git (only first time)**

```sh
git init
```

---

### **3. Add your GitHub repository**

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/binoy0414/Assignments.git
```

*If it says origin exists, run instead:*

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/binoy0414/Assignments.git
```

---

### **4. Add all files**

```sh
git add .
```

---

### **5. Commit your code**

```sh
git commit -m "Commit from Eclipse terminal"
```

---

### **6. Set branch to main**

```sh
git branch -M main
```
git pull origin main --rebase
git push -u origin main

---

### **7. Push to GitHub**

```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 🔐 If Git asks for login:

* **Username** → `binoy0414`
* **Password** → Use your **GitHub Personal Access Token**, *not your GitHub password*

---

### ✅ Next time you only need:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
```

---

If you want, I can also give:

* `.gitignore` for Eclipse/Java
* Auto-push command alias
* Branch workflow guidance

Just tell me.
